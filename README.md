# Caesar Cipher

A Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher for encoding and decoding text. This project was part of the **Scientific Computing with Python** course from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), specifically the *Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher* project.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. This project implements the cipher and allows both encryption and decryption of messages.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Shifts letters in the plaintext by a specified number of positions to produce ciphertext.
- **Decryption**: Reverses the encryption process to return the original message using the shift key.
- Handles both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters, while ignoring non-alphabetical characters.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Caesar-Cipher.git
